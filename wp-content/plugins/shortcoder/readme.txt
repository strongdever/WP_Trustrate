## Frequently Asked Questions

Please visit the [plugin documentation page](https://www.aakashweb.com/docs/shortcoder/) for complete list of FAQs.

### What are the allowed characters for shortcode name?

Allowed characters are alphabets, numbers, hyphens and underscores.

### My shortcode is not working in my page builder!

Please check with your page builder plugin to confirm if the block/place/area where the shortcode is being used can execute shortcodes. If yes, then shortcode should work fine just like regular WordPress shortcodes.

### My shortcode is not working!

Please check the following if you notice that the shortcode content is not printed or when the output is not as expected.

* Please verify if the shortcode content is printed. If shortcode content is not seen printed, check the shortcode settings to see if any option is enabled to restrict where and when shortcode is printed. Also confirm if the shortcode name is correct and there is no duplicate `name` attribute for the shortcode.
* If shortcode is printed but the output is not as expected, please try the shortcode content in an isolated environment and confirm if the shortcode content is working correctly as expected. Sometimes it might be external factors like theme, other plugin might conflict with the shortcode content being used.
* There is a known limitation in shortcodes API when there is a combination of unclosed and closed shortcodes. Please refer [this document](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API#Unclosed_Shortcodes) for more information.

### Can I insert PHP code in shortcode content?

No, right now the plugin supports only HTML, Javascript and CSS as shortcode content.

### Can I use block editor or page builders like Elementor, WPBakery to create shortcode?

Yes, this feature is available in the PRO version. You can upgrade to the [PRO version](https://www.aakashweb.com/wordpress-plugins/shortcoder/) to design using custom editor and create shortcode for that.
